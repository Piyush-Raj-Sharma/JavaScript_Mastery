//Basically in javascript there are multiple type of dataTypes like other languages, eg- number, string, boolean, null, undefiend, objects, and many more

//Its a number data type or we can say its an integer
let num = 99;
console.log(num);
console.log(typeof num);

//its a string data type
let str = "Piyush";
console.log(str);
console.log(typeof str);

//its a boolean datatype
let bool = true;
console.log(bool);
console.log(typeof bool);

// its a special kind of data type called undefined
let undef;
console.log(undef);
console.log(typeof undef);

// its an object data type for null value  // null is also a kind of data type
let none = null;
console.log(none);
console.log(typeof none);

// its another type of special kind of data type in Javascript called NaN = Not a Number
let notNAN = "99dSH";
console.log(notNAN);
console.log(typeof notNAN); // it is showing of an string datatype because "99dSH" is written as a string, but the same value if  get Explictly get typecasted to number, then it will be returned as the NaN = Not a NUmber DataType.
