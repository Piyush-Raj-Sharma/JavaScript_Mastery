// Strings in Javastript is one of the very important topics/concepts to master it. 
// In Javascript we can declare strings in two types :- 1) Primitives from String Literals 2) Objects using Strings() constructors


let str = "Hello I'm Piyush raj Sharma" 
//With this method to declare and initialize string, we simply get a string stored in a variable.

console.log(str);

let str2 = new String("I'm currently studying Strings, Which is very Important to study to get Job(It's my 4 attempt to Study it.)")
//When we use this method to use strings, we get multiple methods/function from __proto__ (prototype) to use with string. 
//Few example of the functions are :-


console.log(str2);
